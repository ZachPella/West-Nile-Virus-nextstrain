📦 What You’ll Need
Tools to Install:

Conda: A package manager to organize your tools. Download here: Conda Installation Guide.

Nextstrain Tools: Augur (for data analysis) and Auspice (for visualization).

Input Files:

Virus Genetic Data (sequences.fasta): Contains RNA sequences of the virus.

Virus Metadata (metadata.tsv): Includes details like collection dates and locations.

🚀 Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Set Up Your Environment with Conda
Goal: Install Conda and Nextstrain tools.

Install Conda: Follow the official guide linked above.

Install Augur:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/nextstrain/augur.git  # Clones the Augur repository  
cd augur  
conda env create -f environment.yml  # Creates a Conda environment  
export NCBI_EMAIL=<YOUR_EMAIL_HERE>  # Required for data downloads  
Activate the Conda Environment:

bash
Copy
conda activate augur  
Install Auspice:

bash
Copy
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs  # Installs Node.js  
npm install --global auspice  # Installs Auspice globally  
Verify Installations:

bash
Copy
augur -h  # Displays help menu for Augur  
auspice -h  # Displays help menu for Auspice  
Expected Outcome: Help menus confirm both tools are installed.

Step 2: Download the Project Files
Goal: Get the West Nile Virus analysis toolkit.

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/ZachPella/West-Nile-Virus-nextstrain.git  
cd WNV_build_test_gitversion  
What Happens: This downloads the project files into a folder named WNV_build_test_gitversion.

Step 3: Run the Analysis Pipeline
Goal: Generate interactive visualizations of the virus’s spread.

Clear Previous Results (Optional):

bash
Copy
snakemake clean  # Removes old files to start fresh  
Execute the Analysis:

bash
Copy
snakemake --cores all  # Runs the full pipeline (takes ~40 minutes)  
What Happens: The pipeline analyzes genetic data, builds evolutionary trees, and prepares maps.

📊 Expected Outputs
Interactive Maps: Visualize the geographic spread of WNV.

Evolutionary Trees: Explore how virus strains are related over time.

County-Level Insights: Track WNV activity in Nebraska counties.

🔍 View Your Results
Goal: Launch a local web server to explore results.

bash
Copy
auspice view --datasetDir ./auspice  
What Happens: A link (e.g., http://localhost:4000) will appear. Open it in your browser to interact with the data!

⚠️ Troubleshooting Tips
Missing Files: Confirm sequences.fasta and metadata.tsv are in the data/ folder.

Permission Issues: Ensure you have write access to the project directory.

Errors: Check the logs/ folder for error details. Contact your IT support if needed.
