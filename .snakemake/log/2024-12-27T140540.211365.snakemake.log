Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	1	ancestral
	1	export
	1	refine
	1	traits
	1	translate

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 75 of /home/fauverlab/nextstrain/WNV_build_test/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/tree_raw.nwk
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
