Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	1	ancestral
	1	export
	1	refine
	1	traits
	1	translate
	1	tree
	7

rule tree:
    input: results/aligned.fasta
    output: results/tree_raw.nwk
    log: logs/tree.log
    jobid: 6


        iqtree -s results/aligned.fasta -m GTR -nt 1 > logs/tree.log

Error in rule tree:
    jobid: 6
    output: results/tree_raw.nwk
    log: logs/tree.log (check log file(s) for error message)
    shell:
        
        iqtree -s results/aligned.fasta -m GTR -nt 1 > logs/tree.log
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
