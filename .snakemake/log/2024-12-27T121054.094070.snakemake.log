Job 6: Building tree

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 61 of /home/fauverlab/nextstrain/WNV_build_test/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/tree_raw.nwk

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
