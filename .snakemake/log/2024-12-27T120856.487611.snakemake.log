Job 6: Building tree

[Fri Dec 27 12:08:56 2024]
Error in rule tree:
    jobid: 6
    output: results/tree_raw.nwk
    shell:
        
        iqtree -s results/aligned.fasta -m GTR --ninit 2 -n 2 --epsilon 0.05 -T AUTO --redo > results/tree_raw.nwk.log
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
